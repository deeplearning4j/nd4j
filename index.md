# ND4J: N-Dimentional-arrays (ND) for Java (4J)

### N-Dimensional Linear Algebra, made *intuitive* and *fast*.

ND4J is a **scientific computing library** for **linear algebra and matrix manipulation** (see [examples](../elementwise.html)) on the JVM. It is meant to be used in **production environments** rather than as a research tool, which means that the routines have been carefully crafted to run **fast** and with **minimum RAM** requirements.

ND4J includes:

* **Versatile** ND-array object.
* **Multiplatform** functionality including GPUs.
* **Linear algebra** and **signal processing** functions.

A usability gap has long enough separated Java, Scala and Clojure programmers from the most powerful tools in data analysis, like [NumPy](http://www.slf4j.org/) or [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/). With ND4J, which is like NumPy, but for Java instead of Python, scientific computing tools are now **open source**, **distributed**, and **integrated** with **GPUs**.

Think [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/). Now imagine Numpy with [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) built into it. That's what you get with ND4J. It gives engineers in **production environments** an easy way to port their algorithms and interface with other libraries native to the Java ecosystem.
