# ND4J: N-Dimentional-Arrays (ND) for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

ND4J -- n-dimensional arrays for Java -- is a scientific computing library for [linear algebra and matrix manipulation](../elementwise.html) on the JVM. It's like Numpy for Java, and  meant to be used in production environments rather than as a research tool.

ND4J includes:

* a versatile ND-array object
* multiplatform functionality including GPUs
* linear algebra and signal processing functions

A usability gap has separated Java, Scala and Clojure programmers from the most powerful tools in data analysis, like Numpy and Matlab. With ND4J, scientific computing tools are now open source, distributed, and integrated with GPUs. Think [SLF4J](http://www.slf4j.org/). 

Now imagine Numpy with Theano built into it. That's what you get with ND4J. It gives engineers in production environments an easy way to port their algorithms and interface with other libraries native to the Java ecosystem.
